# Excel resources in Microsoft Graph

You can access a set of Excel objects (such as Table, Range, or Chart) by using standard REST APIs to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on the workbook. For example, https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/me/drive/items/{id}/workbook/
returns a collection of worksheet objects that are part of the workbook. The [Workbook](workbook.md) (or Excel file) resource contains all the other Excel resources through relationships.

For a conceptual overview and examples that show you how to work with Excel in Microsoft Graph, see [Working with Excel](../concepts/excel.md).

Microsoft Graph supports the following Excel resources on the v1.0 endpoint:

- [Workbook](workbook.md)
- [Worksheet](worksheet.md)
- [Range](range.md)
- [Table](table.md)
- [Chart](chart.md)
- [Named item](nameditem.md)
